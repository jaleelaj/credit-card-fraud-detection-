Project Overview
Fraudulent activities in credit card transactions are on the rise, posing risks to both individuals and financial institutions. This project leverages machine learning to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate, thereby helping to mitigate financial losses.

The notebook includes the following sections:

Data loading and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Model selection and training
Performance evaluation and results visualization
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is not included here but should be in CSV format and contain features such as transaction amount, time, and anonymized principal components of transaction data. The target variable indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent.

Dataset Source: Typically sourced from Kaggle or any other credit card fraud detection datasets available online.

Installation
To run this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Download and place the dataset in the project directory.
Open the Jupyter notebook file:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook "credit card fraud detection.ipynb"
Run each cell sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
Model and Approach
The project implements the following steps to build and evaluate the model:

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and applies SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset.
Model Selection: Uses multiple machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to classify transactions.
Training and Validation: Splits the dataset into training and testing subsets and evaluates models based on precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Evaluation Metrics
The primary evaluation metrics used in this project are:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model.
Precision: Measure of true positive rate.
Recall: Ability to find all true positives.
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Results
The trained model achieved the following performance metrics:

Precision: xx%
Recall: xx%
F1-Score: xx%
Accuracy: xx%
Detailed results and plots are available in the notebook.
